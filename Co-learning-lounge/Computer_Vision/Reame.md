## Concepts

- Prerequisite :

  - Working knowledge of python.
  - Basic experience with Numpy.

- What Is Computer Vision?

  Computer vision is a field of study focused on the problem of helping computers to see.

- What is Deep Learning?

  Just like we use our brains to identify patterns and classify various types of information, deep learning algorithms can be   taught to accomplish the same tasks for machines.

   Example:
   Automatic car driving system is a good example of deep learning.

- Why Deep Learning?

  Deep Learning has many wide applications like smart vision, speech recognition and natural language processing

- Why Deep Learning now?

   Deep learning exits from 1970 but it became popular in the last 5 years due to the following reasons.
   More availability of data and less cost of storage devices
   More computational power availability and more optimized algorithm which takes less power and utilizes less resources.
