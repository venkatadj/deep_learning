Just like we use our brains to identify patterns and classify various types of information, deep learning algorithms can be taught to accomplish the same tasks for machines.

Example:
Automatic car driving system is a good example of deep learning.
Deep Learning has many applications like smart vision, speech recognition and natural language processing

Machine Learning is a subset of AI and these are the algorithms which can learn by themselves without being externally programmed.

Example:
Amazon using machine learning to give better product choice recommendations to there costumers based on their preferences.
Netflix uses machine learning to give better suggestions to their users of the Tv series or movie or shows that they would like to watch.

Artificial Intelligence
AI is a ability of computer program to function like a human brain

Example: Robots like Sophia

Deep learning exits from 1970 but it became popular in the last 5 years due to the following reasons.

More availability of data and less cost of storage devices
More computational power availability and more optimized algorithm which takes less power and utilizes less resources.

Convolutional Neural Networks are a part of Deep learning which are mostly used for computer vision problem.

They are Convolutional Neural networks because most of the layers in the network involves Convolution operation.

The whole CNN started with a Perceptron model. Perceptron model is inspired from human neuron.
The idea of perceptron is that it outputs 1 if the equated sum of inputs and weights are greater than or equal to threshold. It outputs 0 if the equated sum is less than threshold.

Perceptron model has some limitations. 

Example:
 XOR function is not linearly sepearable so we cannot use perceptron to predict truth table of XOR. The output of perceptron is always binary.

So, researchers have taught that network of perceptron model solves these issues and they came up with a architecture called multi layer perceptron architecture.

Convolution operation extracts the features of the image like vertical edges, horizontal edges etc.
Pooling Operation reduces the size of the input while preserving the important features of the image. Pooling operation does down sampling. There are two types of pooling.
Maxpooling : Takes the max of given kernel size
AvgPooling: Takes the average of given kernel size.

Fullyconnected layer: this layer is called fully connected since each input is connected to every neuron in hidden layer.

Popular frameworks in Python for deep learning include caffe, caffe2, pytorch, tenssorflow and keras.

Keras is very user friendly and good for deep learning beginners

How to approach a Image classification problem.
First of all we need a dataset to train our model. We can prepare our dataset or we have some opensource datasets. Some of the pretrained datasets are Imagenet, MNIST, VisualQA etc

Next we need to have a loss function and optimizer. Loss function calculates the loss of our model and optimizer optimizes this loss in such a way that our model learns its weights faster.

Some loss functions: MSE, Catogorical loss entropy
Some Optimizors: SGD, Adam

Then we need a visual algorithm like LENET, Googlenet etc for prediction

And last we needed test dataset to test our model.
